# Projects
### 1. Autonomous UGV
-> Built a self-driving 3 Wheeled bot with lane detection using Raspberry pi.
-> Found the path using color detection & edge detector and then got the curve using the summation of pixels in the y direction i.e a histogram. Trained it using simple CNN.


### 2.Beacon Tracking
The UGV should move towards the maximum vicinity( on the basis of RSSI or Received Signal Strength Indicator values) of
beacon networks in an indoor environment in minimum time.


### 3. UGV Tracing with GPS
Tracing the UGV in a perfect square using GPS and Ardupilot as micro-controller


### 4. UGV tracing usng PID controller
Proposed a simple PID controller with gyroscope feedback to control the path of UGV
